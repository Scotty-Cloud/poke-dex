# Whose that Pokémon ?
<h2>
    Ever been curious on what a certain pokemon has for its base stats or what type of attacks it has? 
    The Pokédex gives users that type of information using the Poké API. 
    This Pokédex contains generations 1-9 of all pokemon created by The Pokémon Company®
    
    **PLEASE NOTE** Poké API may not be up to date and have misleading information on the newer generation of pokemon (Pokemon Generations Sword/Shield as well as Violet/Scarlet)
